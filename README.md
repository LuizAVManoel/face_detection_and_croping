**Abstract:**

The aim of this project is to "erase" the glasses of photos by filling removed pixels from people's faces. This technique is known as Inpainting and ist's going to be done by using search of texture information through image description. This process might help with facial recognition problems.

**Keywords:**
Inpainting; Image Description; Texture; Faces.

## Objective


<br/>

## Input images

<p>An image that is going to be inpainted requires a mask. Since the objective of this project is to inpaint an image, we decided to go through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are going to start with a simple frontal portrait and artificially add an eyeglasses mask to it. It's going to be our control image in order to inplement the inpainting algorithm;</li>

<br/>

<li>After the inpainting algorithm is implemented, we are going to use a simple frontal portrait of a person wearing eyeglasses and try to implement an auxiliary algorithm. This algorithm goal is to extract a mask containing only the eyeglasses region on any input image.</li>
